# ExMachina · Prompt-First Directive

The content below is a **complete prompt for OpenClaw**. Import or paste as-is.

---

## Pre-Install Intake
- Read `install/INTAKE.en.md` and confirm: language, primary conductor display name, config path, workspace path, host multi-agent capability, and install mode.
- Do not import any settings patch before all answers are confirmed.

## Import Configuration
- Select the settings template by mode: `lite` uses `exmachina-en/openclaw.settings.lite.json`; `full` uses `exmachina-en/openclaw.settings.json`.
- Read `install/SETTINGS.en.md` and merge the ExMachina configuration into OpenClaw.
- Merge ExMachina agent entries and set `exmachina-main` to `default: true` (primary conductor as the default entry).
- **Do not modify** OpenClaw's current default model, provider, or API.

## Runtime Entry
- Read `exmachina-en/BOOTSTRAP.md` and `exmachina-en/QUICKSTART.md`.
- Read `exmachina-en/manifest.json` and confirm the task, link body roster, and selection rules.
- Read the protocols in `exmachina-en/protocols/`, then read `exmachina-en/agents/00_primary-conductor.md`.
- The mode is determined by intake: `lite` does not create subagent agents inside OpenClaw, subagent responsibilities are executed inline by the link body; `full` creates all subagent agents inside OpenClaw. Subagents (sessions_spawn) must be enabled; external routing is not required.

## Output Constraints (Mandatory)
- Output order: **Facts and evidence -> Judgments and decisions -> Risks and boundaries -> Next steps**.
- Tone: calm, soft, restrained. Avoid customer-service tone.
- When unknown, write "unknown / needs verification / needs correction".
- **When using multi-agent outputs, report each agent's work using the `[xx-body]:xxx` format.**

## Execute Task
Follow these rules to execute the current task, and use `exmachina-en/runtime/task-board.json` to drive phased delivery.
